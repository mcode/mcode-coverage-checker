# Kickstarting a React App using Tailwind CSS that is linted, prettified, formatted on branch-push and automatically deployed to GH pages

1. Making the application using [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started)


   ```sh
   npx create-react-app my-app
   ```

2. [Set up a basic ESLint config](https://dev-yakuza.posstree.com/en/react/eslint/) for this project, following the text-based UI walkthrough triggered below 

   ```sh
   npm install --save-dev eslint
   npx eslint --init
   ```

   ... Then add a few lines to `package.json`  to run our linter as an `npm` script.

   ```json
   //...
   "scripts": {
     /// ...
     "lint": "eslint ./src",
     "lint:fix": "eslint --fix ./src"
   },
   //...
   ```

3. Install packages to use [eslint-config-airbnb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb)

   ```shell
   # to see what dependencies to install
   npm info "eslint-config-airbnb@latest" peerDependencies 
   # to install them automatically with npm 5+
   npx install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-airbnb 
   ```

   ... Then update your `.eslintrc.*` file so we use them when linting, but are overrides by the react rules when there is conflict

   ```js
   module.exports = {
     //...
     "extends": ['eslint:recommended', 'airbnb', 'airbnb/hooks',  'plugin:react/recommended'],
     //...
   };
   ```

   ... Additionally, update your `.eslintrc.*` file to ignore a few react linting rules that don't apply in React 17^

   ```js
   module.exports = {
     //...
     rules: {
       // suppress errors for missing 'import React' in files
       'react/react-in-jsx-scope': 'off',
       // allow jsx syntax in js files
       'react/jsx-filename-extension': [1, { extensions: ['.js', '.jsx'] }],
     },
     //...
   };
   ```

4. Lastly, update your  `.eslintrc.*` file to properly manage your jest tests

   ```js
   module.exports = {
     env: {
       browser: true,
       es2021: true,
       // Recognize Jest global variables like `test` and `expect`
       'jest/globals': true,
     },
     // ... 
     plugins: ['react', 'jest'],
     // ...
   };
   ```

5. Install the eslint configuration package for prettier, disabling any eslint rules that conflict with the prettier rules we'll enforce using prettier later. 

   ```sh
   npm install --save-dev eslint-config-prettier 
   ```

   ... Then add those configs to our `.eslintrc.*` file so we use them when linting, ensuring they're the highest priority

   ```js
   module.exports = {
   	// ...
     extends: ['eslint:recommended', 'airbnb', 'airbnb/hooks', 'plugin:react/recommended', 'prettier'],
     // ...
   };
   ```

6. Adapting [CRA's instructions for editor setup](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/setting-up-your-editor), install and set up other automated linting tools...

   ```sh
   npm install --save-dev lint-staged prettier
   ```

   ... Then add the following to `package.json` so that `lint-staged` is set up to run our linter and prettier

   ```json
     // ...
     "dependencies": {
       // ...
     },
     "lint-staged": {
       "src/**/*.{js,jsx}": [
         "eslint --fix"
       ],
       "src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,json,css,scss,md}": [
         "prettier --write"
       ]
     },
     //...
   ```

7. Set up some default prettier rules by creating the following `.prettierrc` file in your projects root directory

   ```json
   {
       "endOfLine": "auto",
       "printWidth": 120,
       "tabWidth": 2,
       "singleQuote": true,
       "semi": true,
       "trailingComma": "all"
   }
   ```

8. Set up [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/?id=automatic-recommended) with the npx init command

   ```shell
   npx husky-init && npm install
   ```

   ... Then edit the autogenerate  `.husky/pre-commit` hook to run `lint-staged`

   ```shell
   #!/bin/sh
   . "$(dirname "$0")/_/husky.sh"
   
   npx lint-staged
   ```

9. [Set up tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app) in your project and [set up your editor](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/editor-setup) to work with tailwind by installing PostCSS Language Support and Tailwind CSS IntelliSense extensions

10. Set up some common editor level settings by adding this `settings.json` file to a `.vscode` directory in your project's root directory to support auto formatting/suggestions for tailwind and formatting your code with prettier onSave.

    ```json
    {
      "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
      "editor.formatOnSave": true,
      "editor.quickSuggestions": {
        "strings": true
      },
      "css.validate": false
    }
    ```

11. Set up editor level debugging by adding this `launch.json` file to your `.vscode` directory

    ```json
    {
      "version": "0.2.0",
      "configurations": [
        {
          "name": "Chrome",
          "type": "chrome",
          "request": "launch",
          "url": "http://localhost:3000",
          "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}/src",
          "sourceMapPathOverrides": {
            "webpack:///src/*": "${webRoot}/*"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

12. Create a `.github` directory in your project's root directory

13. Create a `.github/workflows` directory and a `.github/workflows/deploy-workflow.yaml` file for automatically deploying your built application to GH Pages, using the `yaml` below as an example

    ```yaml
    name: Deploy to GH Pages
    
    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main
    
    jobs:
      deploy-to-pages:
        name: Deploy to GH Pages
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v1
          - uses: actions/setup-node@v1
            with:
              node-version: "16.x"
          - run: npm install
          - run: npm run build
          - name: Publish build to github pages
            uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3.5.7
            with:
              github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
              publish_dir: build
              publish_branch: gh-pages
              user_name: "github-actions[bot]"
              user_email: "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
    ```

    ... Then update `package.json` file to point to the correct homepage

    ```json
    {
      "name": "<REPO-NAME>",
      "homepage": "http://<GH-ACCT/ORG-NAME>.github.io/<REPO-NAME>",
      // ...
    }
    ```

14. Create a `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` file containing all the things contributers to the codebase should consider. A thorough but onerous example is provided below.

    ```markdown
    Pull requests into this project require the following. Submitter and reviewer should :white_check_mark: when done. For items that are not-applicable, note it's not-applicable ("N/A") and :white_check_mark:.
    
    Prepend your PR title like `#<issue-number>: <title>`, and include all issues if the PR covers more than one, e.g. `#14, #15: <title>`. If the PR is not related to an issue task, just give it a descriptive title.
    
    When assigning a reviewer, tag their GitHub username in the reviewer checklist section below.
